# Voice-Enabled-Real-Time-Object-Tracking-Using-Image-Processing

# 🚀 Project Objective
To develop a real-time AI-powered system that combines object detection with voice interaction, making monitoring more interactive and hands-free.

# ⚙️ Process

* Load YOLOv8 model for object detection.
* Capture live video using OpenCV.
* Detect and track selected objects with bounding boxes.
* Use a voice engine to announce detected objects.
* Run detection and audio simultaneously with threading.

# 📊 Project Insights

* Detects multiple objects in real time with good accuracy.
* Provides auditory alerts, enhancing usability for accessibility and surveillance.
* Optimized for performance with GPU support and frame resizing.

# 🏁 Final Conclusion
This project shows how computer vision + speech technology can be combined for smarter, more accessible monitoring systems like assistive tools, surveillance, and smart environments.
